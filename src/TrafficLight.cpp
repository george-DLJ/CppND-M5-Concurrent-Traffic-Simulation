/**
 * NOTE for mentor: 
 * The cars are sometimes ignoring the traffic ligths whether:
 * - stay stopeed on a green light or 
 * - they enter some intersections when traffic light is red.
 * I added two _queue.clear one on receive() and one on send() following
 * Knowledge Base recommentations: 
 *  - https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/116321
 *  - https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/267031
 * Since  then the issues described above have notably reduced but 
 * the stuck cars on green  still happens. Specially visible when increasing 
 * lights Phases to larger periods of time, e.g 5-20 seconds.
 * 
 * QUESTIONS:
 * - Why is above described problem happening? 
 * - Should not msg queues precisely avoid that?
 * - If a car goes through a green light and there is a second car on the queue, 
 *    how does this second car knows the state of the Traffic light if the 
 *    traffic light state messsage has been removed from the queue?
